**Sales Data Analysis and Visualization Project**

**Introduction:**
This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of sales data using Python. The dataset used for this project is called `Sales Data.csv`. The main libraries utilized for data cleaning and preparation are Pandas, while visualization is achieved through Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to explore the sales data, identify patterns, trends, and insights, and communicate them effectively through visualizations.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this project is `Sales Data.csv`. It contains information about sales transactions, including attributes such as user_id, customer_name, product_id, gender, age_group, age, marital_status, state, zone, occupation, product_category, orders, amount..

**Data Cleaning:**
The data cleaning process involves the following steps:
1. Removing duplicates.
2. Handling null or missing values.

**Libraries Used:**
1. Pandas: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation.
2. Plotly: Utilized for interactive and dynamic visualizations.
3. Seaborn: Employed for statistical data visualization.
4. Matplotlib: Utilized for creating static visualizations.

**File Structure:**
- `Sales Data.csv`: The raw dataset containing sales data.
- `sales_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and visualization.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib).
3. Open and run the `sales_analysis.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
4. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to perform data analysis and visualization.
